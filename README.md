# Custom Tetris Game

This repository is a simple implementation of the game tetris. I created this project to improve my skills in OOP and with CMake.

## Compilation Steps

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd tetris
```
Create a build directory and navigate to it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Run CMake to configure the project and then build it:
```
cmake ..
make
```
